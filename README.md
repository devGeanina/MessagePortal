## MessagePortal for Desktop
SMS Gateway application allowing users to send SMS messages using an Android device as the GSM modem. The desktop application is part of a multi-device SMS gateway service
that can be used in conjucture with its twin application for Android. The twin applications allow the user to send the desired SMS through their interfaces
instead of using a browser. However, this application can be used standalone as well, using Twilio as the SMS gateway instead of an Android device.

## Pre-requisites
Using it in conjunction with the Android twin application: An Android device and Internet access on both desktop and Android (mobile or wifi). Write down the device's IP generated by your mobile/wifi provider that will be used to make the browser calls or 
for the settings of the desktop application. 
Using it with Twilio: create a Twilio account, get a Twilio number to use as the sender number and also verify in the Twilio interface the number on which you want to send the SMS.
Internet access is also needed.

## Getting Started
Import the project into Netbeans or a platform of your choosing supporting JavaFX. Modify the Twilio authentication token and SID in Utils.java in case you want to also use its service. Install a local Postgresql database to store the information. Set up the database information.
Using it in conjunction with the Android twin application: Provide Internet access for the device used and turn on the server on the main page of the Android application. Set the device's port and IP into the desktop application. Check, to use the Android Gateway, the "Gateway" option in the settings menu as well. The other information will be set as default if not changed.
Using it with Twilio: input the Twilio number obtained through creating the account and uncheck the "Gateway" option in the settings menu. The rest of the information will be set as default if not changed.
Happy texting!


## Settings configuration
The application allows the user to change the following settings:
Using it in conjunction with the Android twin application (Gateway option): 
 * change the database settings to contain your database URL, username and password;
 * change the device port and IP with the ones generated for the Android application. 9090 port is the default;
 * check the Gateway option;
 * credits limit and invoice day restrict the amount of SMS messages sent in the course of a mount (usually set based on your mobile providers invoice). The Unlimited option overrides these options and will disable the credit limit option.
Information on how many SMS messages are left to send until the next invoice is shown in the Info dialog.
Using this Gateway option requires specific parameters to be used while creating the URIs to send down to the HTTP server. These parameters are automatically set in the code but are information on them are displayed in the Gateway URI dialog.
Send the SMS now using the new SMS dialog as you'd normally send out a SMS from your mobile.
Using it with Twilio: 
 * change the database settings to contain your database URL, username and password;
 * uncheck the Gateway option and input the Twilio number created using the Twilio portal (https://www.twilio.com/console) into Settings; remember to verify the phone number that you want to send the SMS to beforehand in the Twilio portal;
 * credits limit and invoice day restrict the amount of SMS messages sent in the course of a mount (usually set based on your mobile providers invoice). The Unlimited option overrides these options and will disable the credit limit option.
